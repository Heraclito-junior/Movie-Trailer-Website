# Movie Trailer Website

The first project for my udacity course of fullstack web development, the project receives a list of movies at entertainment_center.py, and then uses fresh_tomatoes.py to create a HTML page, the page will have the title, a poster of the movie and clicking a poster will open a youtube pop up that will play the trailer of the movie

# How to execute

Run entertainment_center.py in the same paste as media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py
